## Background
<hr>

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. I sought to create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

## Analysis
I created 5 Machine learning models to evalute their accuracy. 
Deep Learning Model: Loss = 0.2514 Accuracy = 0.9062
KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) Model: Training Data Score = 0.83578 Testing Data Score = 0.83066 (k=13)
Logistic Regression Model: Training Data Score = 0.84665 Testing Data Score = 0.86384
Random Forests Model: Training Data Score = 1.0 Testing Data Score = 0.90904
Support Vector Machine:
